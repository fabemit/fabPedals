Sim Racing Pedals

This is my design for a robust set of 3D printed Sim Racing pedals that hopefully shouldn't break the bank.

> [!TIP]
> **Disclaimer** This repository documents my research progress. I wanted to understand the necessary signal processing and control theory algorithms behind such a device. 

> [!WARNING]
> I'm not responsible for any harm caused by this design these are just my ideas and suggestions. Please use responsibly and at your own risk.

# Support the team
We :heart: doing research. New hardware (e.g. oscilloscopes, logic analysers, servos, PCBs) is costly. Feel free to support us and thus accelerate our research activity.

The reason for that license selection is that at some point in time, individuals start
- to steal the sources and binaries and sell them on the internet
- mass production of FFB pedals in their living rooms to make money by taking parts from this project and Simucubes design files.
  
All that, without contributing anything to this project.
