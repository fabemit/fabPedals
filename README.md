Sim Racing Pedals

This is my design for a robust set of 3D printed Sim Racing pedals that hopefully shouldn't break the bank.

> [!TIP]
> **Disclaimer** This repository documents my research progress. I wanted to understand the necessary signal processing and control theory algorithms behind such a device. 

> [!WARNING]
> I'm not responsible for any harm caused by this design these are just my ideas and suggestions. Please use responsibly and at your own risk.

# Support the team
We :heart: doing research. New hardware (e.g. oscilloscopes, logic analysers, servos, PCBs) is costly. Feel free to support us and thus accelerate our research activity.
